# Quantum Circuit Editor

A convenient tool to edit quantum circuits graphically and execute them on a simulator or a backend.

## Overview

This project provides a user-friendly interface for designing, editing, and visualizing quantum circuits. Users can create circuits through an intuitive graphical interface and then execute them using either a built-in simulator or by connecting to quantum computing backends.

## Features

- Graphical quantum circuit editor
- Drag-and-drop interface for quantum gates
- Circuit simulation capabilities
- Integration with quantum computing backends
- Real-time visualization of quantum states
