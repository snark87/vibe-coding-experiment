# Go Code Review Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines the guidelines for reviewing Go code in the Quantum Circuit Editor project. These guidelines aim to ensure that our codebase remains maintainable, readable, and robust as the project evolves.

## Code Review Principles

1. **Be Respectful and Constructive**: Focus on the code, not the author. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
2. **Be Specific**: Point to specific lines of code and explain why a change is recommended.
3. **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than assuming intent.
4. **Consider the Context**: Understand the requirements and constraints of the code you're reviewing.
5. **Suggest, Don't Command**: Use phrases like "Consider..." or "What about..." instead of "Do..." or "Change...".

## What to Look For

### Functionality

- Does the code fulfill the requirements?
- Does it handle edge cases appropriately?
- Are there potential race conditions or concurrency issues?
- Is error handling comprehensive and appropriate?

### Code Structure

- Is the code organized in a logical manner?
- Are packages and files structured according to Go best practices?
- Are there appropriate abstractions, or is functionality duplicated?
- Is the code modular and reusable where appropriate?

### Readability and Maintainability

- Is the code easy to understand?
- Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?
- Are complex sections adequately commented?
- Is the code too complex? Could it be simplified?

### Performance and Efficiency

- Are there potential performance bottlenecks?
- Is memory used efficiently?
- Are there unnecessary computations or allocations?
- Could resource usage be optimized?

### Logging and Observability

- Is logging appropriate and useful for debugging and monitoring?
- Are structured logs used with appropriate log levels?
- Do error logs contain sufficient context?
- Is the `log/slog` package used consistently for structured logging?

### Testing

- Is the code adequately tested?
- Do tests cover edge cases and error scenarios?
- Are tests clear and maintainable?
- Are tests isolated and not dependent on external resources where possible?

### Security

- Are there potential security vulnerabilities?
- Is user input properly validated and sanitized?
- Are appropriate authentication and authorization checks in place?
- Are sensitive data (like credentials) properly protected?

## Specific Go Guidelines to Check

### Package Organization

- Does the package name reflect its purpose?
- Are packages organized by domain rather than by type?
- Is the package focused on a single responsibility?

### Error Handling

- Are errors properly propagated up the call stack?
- Are errors wrapped with meaningful context using `fmt.Errorf()` with `%w`?
- Are error messages clear, specific, and actionable?
- Does the code avoid using `panic` except in truly exceptional circumstances?

### Concurrency

- Is concurrency handled safely with appropriate synchronization?
- Are goroutines properly managed to prevent leaks?
- Is the context package used correctly for cancellation and timeouts?
- Are buffered channels sized appropriately?

### Resource Management

- Are resources (files, connections, etc.) properly closed using defer?
- Is memory usage efficient, avoiding unnecessary allocations?
- Are pools used where appropriate for expensive resources?

### API Design

- Are interfaces focused and minimal?
- Do functions return errors rather than using panics?
- Are exported names (types, functions, etc.) well-documented?
- Do functions accept interfaces rather than concrete types when appropriate?

### Logging Practices

- Is the `log/slog` package used for structured logging?
- Are log levels used appropriately (Debug, Info, Warn, Error)?
- Do logs include relevant context (request IDs, user IDs, etc.)?
- Is sensitive information excluded from logs?

### Common Anti-patterns to Watch For

1. Empty interface (`interface{}`) overuse
2. Excessive nesting of control structures
3. Over-engineering or premature optimization
4. Ignoring errors or using `_ = err`
5. Magic numbers or strings without constants
6. Insufficient comments for complex algorithms
7. Excessively long functions or files
8. Inconsistent error handling strategies
9. Mixing logging and error handling
10. Global mutable state

## Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Code builds without errors or warnings
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New functionality has appropriate test coverage
- [ ] Code follows our Go style guidelines
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and appropriate
- [ ] Logging is useful and follows our structured logging approach
- [ ] Comments are clear and necessary
- [ ] Documentation is updated (including API docs)
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed

## Review Process

1. **Preparation**: Understand the requirements and context of the changes
2. **Technical Review**: Examine the code based on the guidelines above
3. **Testing**: Verify that tests are adequate and pass
4. **Documentation**: Ensure documentation is updated
5. **Feedback**: Provide clear, constructive feedback
6. **Follow-up**: Verify that feedback is addressed in subsequent revisions

## Conclusion

Effective code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and knowledge sharing. By following these guidelines, we can ensure our Go codebase remains robust, maintainable, and aligned with best practices as the Quantum Circuit Editor project evolves.
