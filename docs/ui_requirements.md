## 6. UI States and Transitions

### 6.1 Circuit Editor States
1. **Empty State**: New circuit, no gates placed
2. **Editing State**: Circuit with gates being added/modified
3. **Simulating State**: Processing simulation (loading indicator)
4. **Results State**: Showing simulation results
5. **Error State**: Displaying validation errors or simulation failures

### 6.2 Special UI Considerations

**First-time User Experience**:
- Optional guided tour highlighting key UI elements
- Tooltips for main functions
- Sample circuit templates accessible from empty state

**Error Handling**:
- Clear visual indication of invalid gate placements
- Helpful error messages for simulation failures
- Suggestion of fixes for common errors

**Feedback Mechanisms**:
- Visual confirmation for save operations
- Animation for successful simulation completion
- Progress indication for longer operations

## 7. Visual Design Guidelines

While detailed visual design is not part of these requirements, the UI should follow these principles:

- **Clean and Minimal**: Focus on circuit and results without visual clutter
- **Educational Focus**: Visual design that supports understanding of quantum concepts
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Important actions and information should be visually prominent
- **Consistent Patterns**: Use consistent interaction patterns throughout the application
- **Color Usage**: Use color to convey meaning, not just decoration (e.g., different colors for different gate types)
- **Accessibility**: Sufficient contrast, readable text sizes, and keyboard navigation support

## 8. Mobile Considerations

While the primary focus is desktop usage in educational settings, the interface should:

- Be viewable on tablets and mobile devices
- Collapse less important panels on smaller screens
- Maintain core functionality even on reduced screen sizes
- Consider touch interaction for drag-and-drop operations

## 9. Performance Expectations

The UI should:
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions
- Handle circuit updates smoothly without perceptible lag
- Display loading indicators for operations exceeding 300ms
- Optimize canvas rendering for efficient updates
- Degrade gracefully under poor network conditions

## 10. Summary

The Quantum Circuit Editor UI should focus on creating an intuitive, educational experience with minimal screens and clear workflows. By focusing on a single-page application approach with the Circuit Editor Workspace as the central interface, we can create a streamlined experience that supports the core functionality while minimizing complexity for novice users.

The design should prioritize:
1. Intuitive drag-and-drop circuit construction
2. Clear visual feedback during all operations
3. Educational guidance integrated into the interface
4. Simple simulation and results visualization
5. Straightforward saving and exporting capabilities

This approach aligns with the MVP goals of creating an accessible educational tool for quantum computing concepts while keeping the interface simple and focused.
