# Functional Requirements for Quantum Circuit Editor MVP

## Overview
This document outlines the functional requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Quantum Circuit Editor. Based on the product manager questions and answers, this MVP is designed as an educational tool for students and quantum computing enthusiasts with little to no prior quantum computing or programming experience.

## Core Functionality

### 1. User Interface
1.1. Provide a web-based drag-and-drop interface for creating quantum circuits
1.2. Support simple and intuitive circuit construction with visual feedback
1.3. Enable basic circuit visualization with clear gate representation
1.4. Implement a clean, straightforward UI avoiding overbloated features

### 2. Quantum Circuit Components
2.1. Support basic quantum gates only:
   - X gate (NOT)
   - Y gate
   - Z gate
   - H gate (Hadamard)
   - CNOT gate (Controlled-NOT)
2.2. Allow circuits of 2-5 qubits for educational purposes
2.3. Enable simple circuit construction by dragging gates onto qubit lines

### 3. Simulation Capabilities
3.1. Provide basic circuit simulation functionality
3.2. Display probability distribution of measurement outcomes
3.3. Include simple visualization of circuit execution results
3.4. Optimize simulation for small educational circuits (2-5 qubits)

### 4. Export Functionality
4.1. Support export to QASM format
4.2. Enable saving and loading of circuit designs

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
1.1. Responsive interface suitable for educational use (exact performance metrics not critical for MVP)

### 2. Usability
2.1. Intuitive enough for beginners with no quantum computing or programming experience
2.2. Clear visual feedback during circuit construction
2.3. Simple help/tutorial system to guide new users

### 3. Platform Support
3.1. Web-based application compatible with major browsers
3.2. No specific native platform requirements for MVP

## Success Metrics
1. User adoption among educational institutions
2. Academic citations
3. User feedback specifically from student populations

## Out of Scope for MVP
- Extended gate sets beyond basic gates
- Custom gate definitions
- Real quantum hardware execution (focus on simulation only)
- Advanced visualizations (Bloch sphere, etc.)
- Noise modeling
- Circuits larger than 5 qubits
- Collaboration features
- Integration with classical computing tools
