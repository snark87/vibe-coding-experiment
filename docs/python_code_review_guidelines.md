# Python Code Review Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines the guidelines for reviewing Python code in the Quantum Circuit Editor project. These guidelines aim to ensure that our codebase remains maintainable, readable, and robust as the project evolves.

## Code Review Principles

1. **Be Respectful and Constructive**: Focus on the code, not the author. Provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.
2. **Be Specific**: Point to specific lines of code and explain why a change is recommended.
3. **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than assuming intent.
4. **Consider the Context**: Understand the requirements and constraints of the code you're reviewing.
5. **Suggest, Don't Command**: Use phrases like "Consider..." or "What about..." instead of "Do..." or "Change...".

## What to Look For

### Functionality

- Does the code fulfill the requirements?
- Does it handle edge cases appropriately?
- Is error handling comprehensive and appropriate?
- Does the implementation match the documented behavior?
- Are there potential race conditions or concurrency issues?

### Code Structure

- Is the code organized in a logical manner?
- Are modules and classes structured according to Python best practices?
- Are there appropriate abstractions, or is functionality duplicated?
- Is the code modular and reusable where appropriate?
- Does the code follow the project's directory structure and conventions?

### Readability and Maintainability

- Is the code easy to understand?
- Are variable and function names clear and descriptive?
- Are complex sections adequately commented?
- Is the code too complex? Could it be simplified?
- Does the code follow PEP 8 and our project style guidelines?

### Performance and Efficiency

- Are there potential performance bottlenecks?

- Are appropriate algorithms and data structures used?

### Logging and Observability

- Is logging appropriate and useful for debugging and monitoring?
- Are structured logs used with appropriate log levels?
- Do error logs contain sufficient context?
- Is the standard logging module used consistently?

### Testing

- Is the code adequately tested?
- Do tests cover edge cases and error scenarios?
- Are tests clear and maintainable?

- Are sensitive data (like credentials) properly protected?
- Is code protected against common security issues (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)?

## Specific Python Guidelines to Check

### Package and Module Organization

- Does the module or package name reflect its purpose?
- Is the code organized by domain rather than by type?
- Is each module focused on a single responsibility?
- Does the structure follow the project's conventions?

### Error Handling

- Are exceptions properly caught and handled?
- Are custom exceptions defined for specific error cases?
- Is the original exception preserved when re-raising (using `from`)?
- Are error messages clear, specific, and actionable?
- Does the code avoid using broad exception clauses like `except Exception:`?

### Concurrency

- Is concurrency handled safely with appropriate synchronization?
- Are threads/processes properly managed to prevent resource leaks?
- Is the code correctly using asyncio if applicable?
- Are race conditions and deadlocks avoided?
- Is state properly managed across concurrent operations?

### Resource Management

- Are resources (files, connections, etc.) properly closed using context managers (`with` statements)?
- Is memory usage efficient, avoiding unnecessary allocations?
- Are connections to external services managed properly?
- Are timers and scheduled tasks cleaned up appropriately?

### API Design

- Are functions and methods well-designed with clear purposes?
- Do functions accept and return appropriate types?
- Are interfaces consistent and well-documented?
- Is the API intuitive and easy to use?
- Are docstrings complete and informative?

### Type Annotations

- Are type hints used consistently?
- Are complex types properly defined?
- Are generics used appropriately?
- Does the code pass mypy checks?
- Are type comments used only when necessary (Python <3.6)?

### Logging Practices

- Is the `logging` module used rather than print statements?
- Are log levels used appropriately (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)?
- Do logs include relevant context?
- Is sensitive information excluded from logs?
- Are log messages properly formatted for readability?

### Common Anti-patterns to Watch For

1. **Pythonic Code:**
   - Using list/dictionary comprehensions where appropriate
   - Using generators for large data sets
   - Using context managers for resource handling
   - Leveraging duck typing and EAFP over LBYL

2. **Code Quality:**
   - Overly complex functions or classes
   - Deeply nested control structures
   - "Magic" values not defined as constants
   - Reinventing standard library functionality

3. **Performance:**
   - Inefficient string concatenation (use join or f-strings)
   - Repeatedly accessing dictionary values without caching
   - Creating unnecessary temporary objects in loops
   - Using classes when simple functions would suffice

4. **Testing:**
   - Test logic spread across multiple tests
   - Tests dependent on execution order
   - Tests with unhelpful assertions
   - Mocking what you don't own

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Silently catching exceptions (`except: pass`)
   - Using exceptions for control flow
   - Raising generic exceptions without context
   - Catching exceptions too broadly

## Scientific Computing Specific Guidelines

For our quantum simulation code, also check:

1. **Numerical Stability:**
   - Are floating-point comparisons done with appropriate tolerances?
   - Is the code protected against numerical instability?
   - Are calculations normalized when necessary?

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Is NumPy/SciPy used effectively for matrix operations?
   - Are vectorized operations used instead of loops where possible?
   - Are appropriate data structures used for scientific computing?

3. **Algorithm Implementation:**
   - Does the implementation match the mathematical definition?
   - Is the algorithm numerically stable?
   - Are edge cases handled correctly?

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Are large arrays properly managed?
   - Is memory usage optimized for large quantum states?
   - Are views used instead of copies where appropriate?

## Review Process

### Before the Review

As a code author:
1. **Self-Review**: Review your own code first
2. **Tests**: Ensure all tests pass locally
3. **Linting**: Run Black, isort, mypy, and flake8 on your code
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Scope**: Keep pull requests focused and reasonable in size

### During the Review

As a reviewer:
1. **Preparation**: Understand the requirements and context of the changes
2. **Technical Review**: Examine the code based on the guidelines above
3. **Testing**: Verify that tests are adequate and pass
4. **Documentation**: Ensure documentation is updated
5. **Feedback**: Provide clear, constructive feedback

### After the Review

As a code author:
1. **Respond**: Address all feedback (implement changes or explain why not)
2. **Re-request**: Request another review after addressing feedback
3. **Follow-up**: Thank reviewers for their time and insights

As a reviewer:
1. **Follow-up**: Verify that feedback is addressed in subsequent revisions
2. **Approval**: Approve once satisfied with the changes
3. **Learning**: Consider if any review insights should be added to team documentation

## Code Review Comment Examples

### Good Comments

```
"Consider using a context manager here to ensure the file is closed properly."

"This algorithm might have O(nÂ²) complexity. Have we considered using a more efficient approach for large inputs?"

"I notice we're not handling the case where the input is empty. Should we add a check for that?"

"The variable name 'x' doesn't clarify its purpose. Perhaps 'qubit_index' would be more descriptive?"

"This docstring is missing information about the return value and possible exceptions."
```

### Less Helpful Comments

```
"This code is wrong."

"Fix this."

"I don't like this approach."

"You should use NumPy here."

"Rewrite this entire class."
```

## Python-Specific Best Practices for Review

### 1. Pythonic Code

Look for opportunities to use Python's unique features:

```python
# Less Pythonic
result = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        result.append(x ** 2)

# More Pythonic
result = [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

### 2. Function Arguments

Check for appropriate use of positional, keyword, and default arguments:

```python
# Potential for error
def simulate(qubits, shots=1000, backend=None, optimization=True):
    # ...

# Clearer with explicit keyword arguments
simulate(5, optimization=False)  # Better than simulate(5, 1000, None, False)
```

### 3. Imports

Verify imports are organized properly:

```python
# Standard library
import os
import sys
from datetime import datetime

# Third-party
import numpy as np
from scipy import sparse

# Local application
from quantum_simulator.circuit import QuantumCircuit
from quantum_simulator.gates import HGate, XGate
```

### 4. Context Managers

Look for proper resource management:

```python
# Problematic
f = open('file.txt', 'r')
data = f.read()
f.close()  # May not be called if an exception occurs

# Better
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
```

### 5. Type Hints

Check for appropriate type annotations:

```python
# Without type hints
def apply_gate(circuit, gate, qubit):
    # ...

# With type hints
def apply_gate(
    circuit: QuantumCircuit,
    gate: QuantumGate,
    qubit: int
) -> None:
    # ...
```

## Conclusion

Effective code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality and knowledge sharing. By following these guidelines, we can ensure our Python codebase remains robust, maintainable, and aligned with best practices as the Quantum Circuit Editor project evolves.

Remember that code reviews are not just about finding issues but also about learning from each other and sharing knowledge. Be generous with praise for good code and thoughtful solutions, and be open to feedback on your own code.
