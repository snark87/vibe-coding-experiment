You are a senior software architect. Based on functional requirements and description of epic ARC-0001 write an initial draft of an overview high-level architecture document.

- Put it into ./docs folder
- Don't go too deep into specific: it's an initial draft and a very high-level overview
- Use TODO remarks to mark section where you'd write more details later or where are open questions.
- Use puml for diagrams
