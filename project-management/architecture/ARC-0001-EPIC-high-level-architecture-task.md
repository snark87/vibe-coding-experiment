# High-Level Architecture Design Task

## Overview

This document outlines the task for designing a high-level architecture for the Quantum Circuit Editor MVP. The architecture should support the functional requirements defined in the MVP documentation while considering scalability for future enhancements.

## Background

The Quantum Circuit Editor is being developed as an educational tool for students and quantum computing enthusiasts with little to no prior quantum computing or programming experience. The MVP focuses on providing a simple, intuitive interface for designing and simulating basic quantum circuits.

## Architecture Requirements

Based on the MVP functional requirements, the architecture design should address the following components and considerations:

### 1. User Interface Components
- Design the architecture for a web-based drag-and-drop interface
- Define the component structure for quantum circuit visualization
- Outline the data flow for circuit construction and real-time feedback
- Consider state management for the UI components

### 2. Computational Engine
- Design the simulation engine architecture to support 2-5 qubit circuits
- Define the integration points between UI and simulation components
- Outline how probability distributions will be calculated and displayed
- Consider optimization strategies for calculation performance

### 3. Data Management
- Define the data model for quantum circuits (gates, qubits, connections)
- Design the storage solution for saving and loading circuit designs
- Outline the export functionality architecture for QASM format
- Consider user authentication and circuit ownership model

### 4. Deployment Architecture
- Design a cloud-based architecture supporting multiple users
- Define the hosting and deployment strategy
- Outline scalability considerations for educational use cases
- Consider authentication using Google or similar services

### 5. Technology Stack Recommendations
- Frontend: TypeScript + React (as per team expertise)
- Scientific/Quantum calculations: Python
- Backend services: Go (as per team expertise)
- Define integration points between these technology stacks

## Deliverables

1. High-level architecture diagram showing main components and their interactions
2. Component breakdown with responsibilities and interfaces
3. Data flow diagrams for key user journeys:
   - Circuit creation and editing
   - Circuit simulation and result visualization
   - Circuit saving and loading
   - Circuit export
4. Technology stack recommendations with justifications
5. Security and authentication approach
6. Performance considerations, especially for simulation operations

## Constraints

- The architecture should support a web-based application
- The architecture should leverage the team's expertise in TypeScript+React, Python, and Go
- The design should prioritize simplicity and educational use cases
- The system should support Google authentication or similar simple authentication methods

## Timeline

Please deliver the high-level architecture documentation within [INSERT TIMELINE] for review by the product and development teams.

## Success Criteria

The architecture design will be considered successful if it:

1. Addresses all the functional requirements in the MVP
2. Clearly defines component responsibilities and interfaces
3. Leverages appropriate technologies for different aspects of the system
4. Provides a foundation that can scale to support future enhancements
5. Enables a clear path to implementation for the development team
