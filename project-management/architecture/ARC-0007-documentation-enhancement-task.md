# Documentation Enhancement Task

## Overview

This task focuses on enhancing the documentation for all components of the Quantum Circuit Editor monorepo. Following the successful implementation of the monorepo structure (ARC-0006), comprehensive documentation is needed to ensure smooth onboarding of new team members and efficient collaboration across the development team.

## Deliverables

1. Enhanced README files for each component (frontend, backend, simulation)
2. Project-wide README with monorepo overview
3. Development workflow documentation
4. Component interaction diagrams
5. Local development setup guides

## Tasks

1. Update the main project README.md with:
   - Project overview
   - Repository structure explanation
   - Quick start guide for the entire project
   - Links to component-specific documentation

2. Enhance frontend documentation:
   - Development environment setup
   - Available scripts (build, test, lint)
   - Component architecture overview
   - State management approach

3. Create/update backend documentation:
   - Go environment setup
   - API endpoints documentation
   - Build and run instructions
   - Testing approach

4. Create/update simulation service documentation:
   - Python environment setup
   - Simulation algorithms overview
   - Configuration options
   - Testing instructions

5. Create integration documentation:
   - Component interaction diagrams
   - API contracts between services
   - Data flow diagrams

6. Document the CI/CD workflow:
   - Pipeline stages overview
   - How to troubleshoot common CI issues

## Technical Requirements

1. Documentation should be clear and concise
2. Include code examples where appropriate
3. Use diagrams for complex interactions
4. Ensure all setup instructions are verified to work across development environments
5. Include troubleshooting sections for common issues

## Considerations

1. Documentation should be beginner-friendly but also detailed enough for experienced developers
2. Consider using a consistent documentation structure across all components
3. Include information about environment variables and configuration options
4. Document both Docker-based and native development workflows

## References

- Existing project structure from ARC-0006
- High-level architecture document
- Current CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Definition of Done

1. All README files are updated with comprehensive information
2. Development workflow documentation is complete for all components
3. Setup instructions are verified by at least one other team member
4. Integration documentation clearly explains how components interact
5. Documentation is accessible in the repository for all team members
