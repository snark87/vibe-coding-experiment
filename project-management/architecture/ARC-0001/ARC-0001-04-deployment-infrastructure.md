# Deployment and Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

This task focuses on designing the deployment and infrastructure architecture for the Quantum Circuit Editor. The design should support a cloud-based multi-user environment with appropriate authentication mechanisms.

## Related to Parent Epic

This task is part of the [High-Level Architecture Design Epic](../ARC-0001-EPIC-high-level-architecture-task.md).

## Deliverables

1. Deployment architecture diagram
2. Hosting and deployment strategy document
3. Scalability considerations for educational use cases
4. Authentication implementation approach using Google or similar services

## Tasks

1. Define the cloud infrastructure components needed
2. Design the deployment pipeline and strategy
3. Outline the scalability approach for handling multiple concurrent users
4. Define the authentication implementation using Google or similar services
5. Document the hosting requirements and configuration

## Questions for Product Manager

1. What is the expected number of concurrent users for the MVP?
2. Are there any specific performance SLAs we need to meet?
3. Do we need to support multiple deployment environments (dev, staging, prod)?
4. Are there any data residency requirements or restrictions?
5. What metrics should we collect about system usage?

## Research Questions

1. What cloud provider would be most cost-effective for our educational use case?
2. How should we implement Google authentication for our web application?
3. What containerization approach would be most appropriate?
4. How should we handle database scaling for multi-user support?
5. What monitoring and logging solutions should we implement?
6. What are the security best practices for deploying web applications?
