# Quantum Simulation Engine Architecture

## Overview

This task focuses on designing the architecture for the quantum simulation engine that will power the circuit simulations in the Quantum Circuit Editor. The engine must efficiently simulate 2-5 qubit quantum circuits and generate accurate probability distributions of outcomes.

## Related to Parent Epic

This task is part of the [High-Level Architecture Design Epic](../ARC-0001-EPIC-high-level-architecture-task.md).

## Deliverables

1. Computational engine architecture diagram
2. API specification for the simulation engine
3. Data flow diagram for simulation requests and results
4. Performance considerations document

## Tasks

1. Define the core simulation engine components
2. Design the API for circuit simulation requests
