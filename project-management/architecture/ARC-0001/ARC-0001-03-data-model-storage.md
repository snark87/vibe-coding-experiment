# Data Model and Storage Architecture

## Overview

This task focuses on designing the data model and storage solution for the Quantum Circuit Editor. The design should support saving and loading circuit designs, exporting to QASM format, and handling user authentication and circuit ownership.

## Related to Parent Epic

This task is part of the [High-Level Architecture Design Epic](../ARC-0001-EPIC-high-level-architecture-task.md).

## Deliverables

1. Data model diagram for quantum circuits (gates, qubits, connections)
2. Storage solution architecture
3. QASM export functionality design
4. User authentication and circuit ownership model

## Tasks

1. Define the data model for representing quantum circuits
2. Design the storage solution for saving/loading circuit designs
3. Outline the QASM export functionality
4. Define the user authentication and circuit ownership model
5. Document data flow for saving, loading, and exporting circuits

## Questions for Product Manager

1. Do we need to support collaborative editing of circuits or is single-user editing sufficient?
2. What metadata should be stored with each circuit (name, description, creation date, etc.)?
3. Do we need version control for circuits or just the latest version?
4. Should users be able to share circuits with others, and if so, how?
5. Are there specific privacy requirements for stored circuits?

## Research Questions

1. What data format would be most efficient for storing quantum circuits?
2. How can we ensure backward compatibility as we add new features?
3. What are the industry standards for quantum circuit representation?
4. What authentication solution would be most appropriate for our educational use case?
5. How should we handle data persistence (database vs. file storage)?
6. What are the security considerations for storing user circuits?
