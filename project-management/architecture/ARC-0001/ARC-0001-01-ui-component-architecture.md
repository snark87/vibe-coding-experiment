# UI Component Architecture Design

## Overview

This task focuses on designing the UI component architecture for the Quantum Circuit Editor. The design should support a web-based drag-and-drop interface that allows users to create and visualize quantum circuits intuitively.

## Related to Parent Epic

This task is part of the [High-Level Architecture Design Epic](../ARC-0001-EPIC-high-level-architecture-task.md).

## Deliverables

1. UI component hierarchy diagram
2. State management approach for UI components
3. Component interaction model for drag-and-drop functionality
4. Description of real-time feedback mechanisms during circuit construction

## Tasks

1. Define the main UI components (circuit canvas, gate palette, control panel, etc.)
2. Design the component hierarchy and relationships
3. Outline the state management strategy for circuit state
4. Define the drag-and-drop interaction model
5. Specify how components will handle user events and provide feedback

## Questions for Product Manager

1. What level of visual feedback do users need during circuit construction? (e.g., gate validation, suggestions, warnings)
2. Are there any specific accessibility requirements for the UI components?
3. Should the UI scale/adjust for different screen sizes or is it primarily designed for desktop use?
4. Are there any reference UIs from existing tools that we should consider as models?
5. What are the most important visual cues needed during circuit construction?

## Research Questions

1. What are the best practices for implementing drag-and-drop interfaces in React?
2. How do similar scientific/mathematical tools handle complex state management?
3. What React state management solutions would best fit our use case (context API, Redux, MobX, etc.)?
4. What are the performance considerations for rendering quantum circuits as they grow in complexity?
5. Are there any open-source libraries for quantum circuit visualization that we could leverage?
