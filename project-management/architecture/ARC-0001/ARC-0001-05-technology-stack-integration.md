# Technology Stack Integration Architecture

## Overview

This task focuses on designing the integration architecture between the different technology stacks used in the Quantum Circuit Editor: TypeScript+React for frontend, Python for scientific calculations, and Go for backend services.

## Related to Parent Epic

This task is part of the [High-Level Architecture Design Epic](../ARC-0001-EPIC-high-level-architecture-task.md).

## Deliverables

1. Technology stack integration diagram
2. API and communication protocols design
3. Service boundary definitions
4. Integration testing approach

## Tasks

1. Define the integration points between frontend (TypeScript+React) and backend (Go)
2. Design the integration between Go backend services and Python scientific calculations
3. Outline the API contracts between different technology layers
4. Define the communication protocols and data formats
5. Document the testing approach for cross-technology integration

## Questions for Product Manager

1. Are there any specific performance requirements for the communication between frontend and backend?
2. Do we need real-time updates for simulation results or is a request-response model sufficient?
3. Are there any existing integration patterns we should follow from other projects?
4. What level of resilience and fault tolerance do we need in the integration?
5. How should integration errors be presented to users?

## Research Questions

1. What are the best practices for calling Python scientific code from Go services?
2. How should we structure the API between React frontend and Go backend?
3. What serialization format would be most efficient for quantum data (JSON, Protocol Buffers, etc.)?
4. Should we implement a microservices architecture or a monolithic approach for the MVP?
5. What are the security considerations for API communication?
6. How can we optimize the integration to minimize latency in simulation results?
