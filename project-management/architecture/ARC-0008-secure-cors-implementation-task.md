# Secure CORS Implementation Documentation Task

## Overview

This task focuses on documenting a secure approach to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the Quantum Circuit Editor backend. The current implementation uses a wildcard CORS configuration that allows all origins, which presents security concerns for a production environment as noted in the recent code review. This task will address these concerns by documenting best practices and environment-specific CORS configurations that development teams can implement.

## Deliverables

1. Comprehensive documentation of secure CORS configuration approaches for different environments
2. Environment-specific CORS configuration recommendations
3. Best practices and security considerations document

## Tasks

1. Research and document CORS security best practices for Go applications
2. Define recommended CORS settings for each environment:
   - Development: Configurable with sensible defaults
   - Staging: Restricted to specific staging domains
   - Production: Strictly limited to production domains

3. Document recommended environment variable approach for controlling CORS settings

4. Document validation strategies for CORS configuration

5. Create a reference guide for the development team

## Technical Requirements for the Document

1. Document must explain why wildcard CORS should never be used in production environments
2. Document should cover secure header configurations
3. Document should provide flexible approaches to accommodate future domains
4. Document should explain the principle of least privilege as applied to CORS
5. Document should address the concerns raised in the code review
6. Document should be understandable by developers with minimal security background

## Document Sections

### 1. Introduction to CORS Security

- Brief explanation of CORS purpose and security implications
- Common vulnerabilities associated with insecure CORS configurations
- Why the current wildcard implementation is problematic

### 2. Environment-Specific CORS Strategy

- Development environment recommendations
- Testing environment recommendations
- Staging environment recommendations
- Production environment recommendations

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

- Environment variable configuration approach
- Recommended CORS header settings
- Preflight request handling
- Reasonable cache duration settings

### 4. Security Considerations

- Origin validation best practices
- Header exposure recommendations
- Cookie security with CORS
- Credential sharing considerations
- Mitigating common CORS-related attack vectors

### 5. Testing and Validation

- How to validate CORS configurations
- Testing cross-origin requests properly
- Common CORS configuration errors to avoid

### 6. Go-Specific Implementation Guidance

- Popular CORS packages and their security features
- Go code patterns for secure CORS implementation
- Common pitfalls in Go CORS implementations

## Considerations

1. Consider the impact on local development workflows
2. Ensure that testing environments can be easily configured
3. Consider future integration with potential third-party services
4. Evaluate the impact on authentication and cookie-based sessions

## References

- Original code review findings in `/docs/review/7d70acd_review.md`
- OWASP CORS security guidelines
- Go's rs/cors package documentation
- High-level architecture document security section

## Definition of Done

1. Comprehensive CORS security documentation is created
2. Environment-specific recommendations are clearly articulated
3. Implementation guidance is clear enough for developers to follow
4. Documentation addresses all security concerns raised in the code review
5. Documentation includes examples of secure CORS configuration
