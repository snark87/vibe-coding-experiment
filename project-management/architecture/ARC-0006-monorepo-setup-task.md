# Initial Monorepo Setup Task

## Overview

This task focuses on establishing the initial monorepo structure for the Quantum Circuit Editor project. Based on our high-level architecture, the project consists of frontend (React/TypeScript), backend (Go), and simulation (Python) components that need to be organized in a maintainable monorepo structure.

## Deliverables

1. Initial monorepo directory structure
2. Basic build and development setup for each component
3. Simple CI/CD pipeline configuration
4. Documentation for development workflow

## Tasks

1. Create the basic repository structure for the three main components:
   - Frontend (TypeScript/React)
   - Backend (Go)
   - Simulation service (Python)

2. Set up minimal build configurations for each component:
   - TypeScript setup for frontend
   - Go modules for backend
   - Python package structure for simulation

3. Configure a simple CI/CD pipeline using either GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with GitHub integration (architect's choice based on project needs)

4. Create Docker configuration for local development

5. Document the development workflow including:
   - How to set up the development environment
   - How to build and run each component
   - How to run tests

## Technical Requirements

1. Keep the build system as simple as possible - avoid complex build tools or monorepo-specific frameworks unless absolutely necessary
2. Ensure good separation between the components while allowing for shared types/models
3. Enable independent development and testing of components
4. CI pipeline should validate all components and their integration

## Suggested Structure

```
quantum-circuit-editor/
├── frontend/            # React TypeScript frontend
├── backend/             # Go backend services
├── simulation/          # Python simulation service
├── docs/                # Project documentation
├── scripts/             # Shared development and CI scripts
└── docker-compose.yml   # Local development setup
```

## Considerations

1. Consider using Docker Compose for local development to simplify the running of multiple services
2. Ensure the repository structure allows for future expansion of components
3. Implement a consistent code style and linting across all components
4. The monorepo should support the integration strategy outlined in the high-level architecture document
5. CI/CD should be configured to run tests and builds for affected components only when possible

## References

- High-level architecture document contains details on the integration between components
- React, Go, and Python best practices should be followed for respective components

## Definition of Done

1. Repository structure is created and documented
2. Basic build configuration is in place for all components
3. CI/CD pipeline is configured and running successfully
4. Local development can be set up with clear documentation
5. All team members can successfully build and run the components independently
