# Circuit Validation Error Test

## Overview
This test verifies that the Quantum Circuit Editor correctly validates circuit configurations and provides appropriate error feedback to users attempting invalid operations. Testing error handling is critical for educational tools to ensure users understand why certain operations aren't valid.

## Test Environment
- Browser: All supported browsers (to be defined)
- Screen size: Desktop (minimum size to be defined)
- User type: Guest user

## Preconditions
- User has opened the Quantum Circuit Editor application
- A blank circuit with 2 qubits is displayed

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Temporal Gate Conflict

**Steps:**
1. Drag an H gate onto qubit 0, position 0 (first time step)
2. Attempt to drag another H gate onto qubit 0, position 0 (same time step)

**Expected Results:**
- Visual indication that placement is invalid (red highlight or similar)
- Clear error message displayed: "Gates cannot overlap on the same qubit at the same time"
- Second gate is not placed on the circuit
- First gate remains in position
- User can still place the gate in a valid position (next time step)

### 2. Invalid CNOT Self-Connection

**Steps:**
1. Drag a CNOT gate from the palette
2. Attempt to connect both the control and target points to the same qubit

**Expected Results:**
- Visual indication that connection is invalid (red connection line or similar)
- Error message displayed: "CNOT gates require two different qubits for control and target"
- Gate is not placed on the circuit
- User can still connect the CNOT between different qubits

### 3. Circuit Edge Placement

**Steps:**
1. Add several gates to fill most of the visible circuit area
2. Attempt to place a gate beyond the visible circuit boundary

**Expected Results:**
- Circuit should either:
  a) Automatically extend to accommodate more gates OR
  b) Provide clear feedback that maximum circuit width is reached
- If scrolling/panning is supported, circuit should allow extension via scrolling
- No system errors or crashes occur

### 4. Rapid Multiple Gate Placement

**Steps:**
1. Quickly drag and attempt to place multiple gates in rapid succession
2. Try to place gates slightly offset from grid positions

**Expected Results:**
- System handles rapid interactions without performance degradation
- Gates snap correctly to grid positions
- Invalid placements are consistently rejected
- Valid placements are consistently accepted
- No system freezes or unresponsive behavior

### 5. Browser Zoom Impact

**Steps:**
1. Set browser zoom to 80%
2. Attempt to place gates on the circuit
3. Change browser zoom to 125%
4. Attempt to place more gates

**Expected Results:**
- Gate placement accuracy is maintained at different zoom levels
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid placements works correctly at all zoom levels
- Error messages remain visible and readable
- Circuit grid alignment is maintained

### 6. Response to Quick Corrections

**Steps:**
1. Begin dragging a gate toward an invalid position
2. Before releasing, redirect to a valid position

**Expected Results:**
- System correctly updates validation feedback during drag operation
- Error indicators disappear when moving to valid positions
- Success indicators appear when over valid positions
- Final placement reflects last valid position targeted

## Special Considerations

### Error Message Clarity
- Error messages should use beginner-friendly language
- Technical quantum computing terms should be explained if used
- Messages should suggest correct action when possible

### Error Visual Design
- Error indicators should be clearly visible but not alarming
- Color choices should consider accessibility (not just red for errors)
- Errors should not obstruct the circuit view unnecessarily

### Error States Persistence
- Error messages should remain visible long enough to read
- Error states should clear appropriately when resolved
- Multiple simultaneous errors should be handled gracefully

## Test Data
- No specific test data required beyond basic circuit elements

## Traceability
- Requirement 1.2: Support simple and intuitive circuit construction with visual feedback
- Requirement 1.3: Enable basic circuit visualization with clear gate representation
- Technical Validation Requirements from Quantum Scientist's feedback

## Notes
- This test focuses specifically on error handling and validation feedback
- Comprehensive error testing is critical for educational applications
- User frustration with unclear error messages could significantly impact the educational value
- These tests should be performed across all supported browsers and at various screen sizes
- Pay special attention to the specific wording of error messages for technical accuracy and beginner friendliness
