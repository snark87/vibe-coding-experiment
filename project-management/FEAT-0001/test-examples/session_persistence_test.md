# Session Persistence Test

## Overview
This test validates that the guest user circuit creation feature correctly maintains circuit state during a browser session. Since guest users don't have authentication, the proper functioning of session storage is critical to prevent unexpected data loss.

## Test Environment
- Browser: All supported browsers (to be defined)
- Screen size: Desktop (minimum size to be defined)
- User type: Guest user

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Session Persistence

**Steps:**
1. Open the Quantum Circuit Editor as a guest user
2. Create a simple circuit (e.g., place an H gate on qubit 0)
3. Refresh the browser page
4. Observe the circuit state after refresh

**Expected Results:**
- Circuit state is preserved after page refresh
- All gates remain in the same positions
- No error messages are displayed

### 2. Browser Tab Navigation

**Steps:**
1. Open the Quantum Circuit Editor as a guest user
2. Create a circuit with multiple gates
3. Open a new browser tab and navigate to other websites
4. Return to the Quantum Circuit Editor tab
5. Observe the circuit state

**Expected Results:**
- Circuit state is fully preserved when returning to the tab
- No performance degradation after tab switching
- No unexpected UI state changes

### 3. Multiple Browser Tabs

**Steps:**
1. Open the Quantum Circuit Editor in Tab A
2. Create Circuit X in Tab A
3. Open a new Tab B and navigate to the Quantum Circuit Editor
4. Create a different Circuit Y in Tab B
5. Switch between tabs

**Expected Results:**
- Tab A maintains Circuit X state independently
- Tab B maintains Circuit Y state independently
- Changes in one tab do not affect the other tab
- Both sessions function correctly

### 4. Session Duration Test

**Steps:**
1. Create a circuit
2. Leave the browser open but inactive for 10 minutes
3. Return to the browser and interact with the circuit
4. Leave the browser open but inactive for 30 minutes
5. Return and interact with the circuit again

**Expected Results:**
- For 10-minute inactivity: Session remains active, circuit state preserved
- For 30-minute inactivity: If session timeout is configured, appropriate notification should appear
- If no timeout is configured, circuit state should still be preserved
- No unexpected behavior when resuming interaction after inactivity

### 5. Browser Crash Recovery

**Steps:**
1. Create a circuit with multiple gates
2. Forcibly close the browser (simulate crash)
3. Reopen browser and navigate back to the Quantum Circuit Editor
4. Observe the circuit state

**Expected Results:**
- Ideally: Circuit state is recovered from previous session
- Alternatively: Clear message that previous unsaved work could not be recovered
- No system errors upon recovery attempt
- Editor is in usable state for creating new circuit

### 6. Session Storage Limitations

**Steps:**
1. Create a complex circuit using maximum number of qubits (3) and filling with many gates
2. Add, remove, and reposition gates multiple times
3. Refresh browser and check state preservation
4. Try to create even more complex configurations

**Expected Results:**
- Circuit state is preserved correctly even with complex configurations
- No degradation in performance as circuit complexity increases
- No errors related to storage limitations
- Proper handling if storage limits are reached (clear message if applicable)

### 7. Multiple Device Session Test

**Steps:**
1. Create a circuit on Desktop browser
2. Note the exact configuration
3. Using the same browser type but on a different device or screen size, navigate to the editor
4. Observe whether session is shared or independent

**Expected Results:**
- Sessions should be device-specific (not synchronized across devices)
- Each device starts with a new, empty circuit
- No unexpected behavior when using multiple devices

## Special Considerations

### Session Storage Implementation
- Test specifically targets the session storage implementation
- Focus on robustness and reliability of the storage mechanism
- Attention to edge cases around storage limitations

### User Awareness
- Verify any session-related notifications are clearly presented
- Check that session limitations are communicated to users
- Ensure temporary nature of guest sessions is obvious

### Browser Settings Impact
- Test with different cookie/storage permission settings
- Verify behavior with private/incognito browsing mode
- Test with various browser security settings

## Test Data
- No specific test data required beyond circuit configurations

## Traceability
- Non-Functional Requirements related to session persistence for guest users

## Notes
- This test is critical for the guest user experience
- Failure of session persistence would result in significant user frustration
- Communication of session limitations is as important as the technical implementation
- Guest users should understand that their work is temporary without authentication
