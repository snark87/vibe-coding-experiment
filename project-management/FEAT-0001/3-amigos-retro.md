# 3 Amigos Meeting Retrospective - FEAT-0001

## Overview

This document captures the retrospective of our 3 amigos meeting for the Guest User Circuit Creation feature (FEAT-0001). The meeting involved participants from Product, QA, Quantum Science, UI/UX, and Architecture disciplines, all of whom were LLM agents collaborating to refine the feature requirements.

## What Went Well

1. **Comprehensive Role Coverage**
   - All key perspectives were represented: Product, QA, Quantum Science, UI/UX, and Architecture
   - Each role contributed valuable domain-specific insights to the feature discussion
   - The collaborative approach helped identify cross-functional concerns that might have been missed

2. **Detailed Technical Exploration**
   - The quantum scientist provided excellent, detailed explanations of circuit validation rules
   - UI/UX offered multiple visualization approaches with clear pros and cons
   - Architecture raised important feasibility and performance considerations early

3. **Structured Problem Decomposition**
   - The team successfully broke down complex problems into actionable items
   - Clear technical requirements emerged from high-level feature descriptions
   - Testing scenarios were comprehensively outlined for key functionality

4. **Education-First Approach**
   - Strong focus on making the tool accessible to beginners while respecting industry standards
   - Detailed discussion of error messaging as an educational opportunity
   - Thoughtful consideration of progressive disclosure of complexity

5. **Actionable Outputs**
   - Generated concrete action items with clear ownership
   - Comprehensive test cases were documented for future implementation
   - Design decisions were captured with clear rationales

## What Did Not Go Well

1. **Over-Engineering Tendencies**
   - Some proposed solutions were overly complex for an MVP implementation
   - Discussion occasionally drifted into future capabilities outside the current scope
   - Architecture concerns sometimes preceded basic functionality definitions

2. **Inconsistent Participation Timing**
   - Architecture perspective came relatively late in the discussion
   - Some clarifications from the Product Owner were delayed
   - Earlier involvement of all disciplines could have streamlined decision-making

3. **Unclear Decision Ownership**
   - Some discussions ended without clear resolution or decision owner
   - Multiple options were presented without definitive selection or criteria
   - The path forward on error visualization remained partially unresolved

4. **Documentation Fragmentation**
   - Insights were scattered across multiple sections rather than consolidated
   - Some redundant information appeared across different role perspectives
   - No single source of truth emerged for certain key decisions

5. **Bandwidth Management**
   - The depth of exploration sometimes exceeded what was needed for initial implementation
   - Time could have been better allocated to prioritized concerns
   - Some roles received significantly more attention than others

## What Blocked Us

1. **Competing UI Approaches**
   - Multiple visualization options for error states created decision paralysis
   - No clear selection criteria established for choosing between approaches
   - Required forming a separate decision team, adding process overhead

2. **Technical vs. Educational Balance**
   - Tension between industry-standard representations and beginner-friendly approaches
   - Difficult to find consensus on the right level of simplification
   - Quantum science correctness sometimes conflicted with UX simplicity

3. **Scope Boundaries**
   - Uncertainty about where to draw the line for MVP features
   - Discussions frequently ventured into simulation capabilities (explicitly out of scope)
   - Unclear boundaries between this feature and future enhancements

4. **Absence of User Research**
   - Lacked concrete user feedback on proposed approaches
   - Heavy reliance on assumptions about beginner needs
   - No objective data to resolve competing design approaches

5. **Technical Constraint Knowledge**
   - Incomplete understanding of browser storage limitations
   - Uncertainty about performance implications of real-time validation
   - Limited clarity on cross-browser compatibility requirements

## What Can We Improve in the Future

1. **Structured Decision Framework**
   - Implement a clear decision-making framework with defined owners
   - Establish explicit criteria for evaluating competing approaches
   - Document decisions in a centralized location with rationales

2. **Prioritization Matrix**
   - Create a clear matrix for feature priority vs. implementation complexity
   - Use MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) for feature classification
   - Ensure all participants understand priority levels for each requirement

3. **Time-Boxed Topic Exploration**
   - Allocate specific time limits for each discussion topic
   - Use a parking lot for capturing important but tangential issues
   - Ensure balanced attention across all critical perspectives

4. **Earlier Cross-Functional Involvement**
   - Include architecture perspective from the beginning
   - Ensure all roles have visibility to initial requirements before detailed discussions
   - Use collaborative document editing during the meeting to capture insights real-time

5. **User-Centered Validation**
   - Incorporate plans for user testing of competing approaches
   - Use hypotheses and experiments to validate assumptions
   - Create lightweight prototypes to test key interaction patterns

6. **Technical Spike Planning**
   - Identify technical unknowns requiring investigation before full implementation
   - Schedule dedicated technical spikes for high-risk architectural components
   - Document findings to inform implementation strategies

7. **Standardized Output Templates**
   - Create standardized templates for capturing decisions, actions, and open questions
   - Ensure clear ownership and due dates for all action items
   - Maintain a single source of truth for meeting outcomes

8. **Iterative Approach Emphasis**
   - Be explicit about implementation phases and iterations
   - Focus MVP discussions strictly on minimal viable implementation
   - Create separate space for capturing future enhancements

## Conclusion

The 3 amigos meeting successfully brought together diverse perspectives and generated valuable insights for the Guest User Circuit Creation feature. While we identified several areas for process improvement, the collaboration produced a strong foundation of requirements, design direction, and testing scenarios to guide implementation.

In future meetings, we should focus on more structured decision-making processes, clearer scope boundaries, and earlier cross-functional collaboration to maximize efficiency and clarity of outcomes.
